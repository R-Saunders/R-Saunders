## 💻 Projects
I am currently working on my first project, a wikipedia for cryptids, creates of myth, legend and folklore.   
I have always been a big fan of fantasy as well as myths, legends and folklore. I have always found it's hard to find a central catalogue or compendium for these. So, I decided to make one.   
I'm sure I will need some help filling it up and much like Wikipedia I'll be reaching out once I have everything in place.   
I hope that this will serve not only as a great knowledge base for those who have interest in cryptozoology but also serve as a great place of inspiration for creatives working on their own creatures and tales.

🧑‍💼 I have a lot of experience as a people manager, managing small & focused teams of just three people as well as larger teams of 20+ people.
