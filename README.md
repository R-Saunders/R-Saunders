## 💻 Projects
1️⃣ I am currently working on my first project.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🐉 I am making a wiki type site for cryptids, creatures of myth, legend and folklore.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🦄 I have always found it's hard to find a compendium for cryptids so I decided to make one.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧛 I will be looking for community contributions to help fill it out, just like any other wiki.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧟 I hope it will serve as a knowledge base for cryptozoologists.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧙‍♀️ And as a place of inspiration for creatives.   
2️⃣ I am also working on building my own website and portfolio.      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 💡 It's a work in progress I am excited to debut.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🤔 It will be my first portfolio so feedback is very welcome!     
3️⃣ Another website on it's way for my partner.    
4️⃣ [The Box Model](https://www.theboxmodel.co.uk) - A single page site to serve as an educational tool for those learning about the box model within CSS.
