## 💻 Projects
1️⃣ I am currently working on my first project.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🐉 I am making a wiki type site for cryptids, creatures of myth, legend and folklore.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🦄 I have always found it's hard to find a central catalogue or compendium for cryptids and fantastical creatures. So, I decided to make one.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧛 I will be looking for community contributions to help fill it out, just like any other wiki.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧟 I hope that this will serve not only as a great knowledge base for cryptozoologists but also serve as a great place of inspiration for creatives too.   
2️⃣ I am also working on building my own website and portfolio.      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 💡 It's a work in progress I am excited to debut.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🤔 It will be my first portfolio so feedback is very welcome!
